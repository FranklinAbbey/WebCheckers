    - Run 'Application' file (intelliJ: right click > Run)
    - While application is running open two browser windows:
            - If they are the same web application (ex: 2 Chrome windows)
              change one to incognito mode (crtl + shift + N)
    - Go to 'http://localhost:4567/' in both windows

To use the testing board (board with only 2 pieces makes testing a little easier):

        1. Line 65 in 'CheckersGame' class. Comment out line 63
        2. Lines 58 - 63 in 'Board' class
